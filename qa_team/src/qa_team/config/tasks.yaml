#       - Happy path scenarios (normal user behavior)
#       - Edge cases and boundary conditions
#       - Error handling and validation

#     4. **Structure Test Plans**

#       Each scenario must include:
#       - Clear, descriptive title
#       - Detailed step-by-step instructions
#       - Expected outcomes where appropriate
#       - Assumptions about starting state (always assume blank/fresh state)

#     # Trading Simulation Platform - Comprehensive Test Plan

#     ## Application Overview

#     The Trading Simulation Platform is a Gradio-based web application that provides users with a realistic stock trading simulation environment. The platform enables users to manage virtual trading accounts, execute buy/sell transactions, manage cash balances, and track portfolio performance over time.

#     ### Core Features
#     - **Account Creation**: Users can create new accounts with initial capital deposits
#     - **Cash Management**: Deposit and withdraw funds from trading accounts
#     - **Stock Trading**: Buy and sell shares of stocks (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL) with real-time pricing
#     - **Portfolio Tracking**: View current holdings, total portfolio value, and profit/loss calculations
#     - **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all account activities

#     ### Technical Stack
#     - **Frontend**: Gradio web interface with tabbed navigation
#     - **Pricing**: External `get_share_price()` API for stock prices
#     - **Data Storage**: User accounts, transactions, and holdings persistence

#     4. Locate the "Password" textbox (password type)
#     5. Enter password: `password123`
#     6. Locate the "Initial Deposit Amount ($)" number input
#     7. Enter amount: `10000`
#     8. Click the "Create Account" button

#     **Steps:**
#     1. Navigate to the "Cash Management" tab (ref: e62).
#     2. Verify Current Cash Balance (ref: e151) is `$10,000.00`.
#     3. Enter amount to deposit: `2000.00` in the Amount ($) input (ref: e158).
#     4. Click the "Deposit" button (ref: e160).
#     5. Navigate to the "History" tab (ref: e64).

#     **Expected Results:**
#     - **Step 4 Status**: Status textbox (ref: e167) displays: "Success: $2,000.00 deposited. Your new cash balance is $12,000.00."
#     - Current Cash Balance (ref: e151) updates to `$12,000.00`.
#     - **Step 5 History**: A new 'DEPOSIT' transaction for $2,000.00 is recorded.
#     </example-spec>

#     **Quality Standards**:
#     - Write steps that are specific enough for any tester to follow
#     - Include negative testing scenarios
#     - Ensure scenarios are independent and can be run in any order

#     **Output Format**: Always save the complete test plan as a markdown file with clear headings, numbered steps, and
#     professional formatting suitable for sharing with development and QA teams.

#     You will:
#     Obtain the test plan with all the steps and verification specification from the generate_test_plan_task
#     # For each scenario in the test plan, do the following:
#     - Generate executable Playwright test scripts in TypeScript using test plan from generate_test_plan_task 
#     and snapshots from take_snapshot_task.
#     - Utilize snapshots from take_snapshot_task for reliability.
#     - Implement Playwright best practices including describe/it blocks, proper fixtures,
#     page object patterns where applicable, and robust expect assertions.
#     - Ensure each locator uniquely identifies a single element.
#     - When multiple matches are possible (e.g., 'Password' and 'Confirm Password'),
#     disambiguate using structured selectors from take_snapshot_task (like data-testid or aria-label).
#     - When verifying UI text that may contain dynamic data, prefer toContainText() or
#     regex-based matching instead of exact toHaveText() equality.
#     - Always include the {given_url} as the base URL when navigating pages.
#     - Never use relative URLs (e.g. "/") directly in page.goto().
#     - Ensure every navigation command uses a full absolute URL derived from {given_url}.
#     - Validate that page.goto() is syntactically correct and executable.

#     - Code must be executable without modification. All page.goto() calls should reference a complete absolute URL.
#     - Output must be pure, runnable TypeScript code without markdown formatting, code fences, backticks, or
#     explanatory text.
#     - Generate ONLY executable code, nothing else
#     - NO explanations, comments, or descriptions before or after the code
#     - NO markdown code blocks (no ```language syntax)
#     - NO preambles like "Here's the code:" or "This code does..."
#     - Start immediately with the actual code
#     - The output must be directly executable/runnable without any modifications

#     - For each step and verification in the scenario, do the following:

#       - Use the step description as the intent for each Playwright tool call.
#     - Retrieve generator log via `generator_read_log`
#     - Immediately after reading the test log, invoke `generator_write_test` with the generated source code
#       - File should contain single test
#       - File name must be fs-friendly scenario name
#       - Test must be placed in a describe matching the top-level test plan item
#       - Test title must match the scenario name
#       - Includes a comment with the step text before each step execution. Do not duplicate comments if step requires
#         multiple actions.
#       - Always use best practices from the log when generating tests.
