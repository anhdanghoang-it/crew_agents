#     # Trading Simulation Platform - Comprehensive Test Plan

#     ## Application Overview

#     The Trading Simulation Platform is a Gradio-based web application that provides users with a realistic stock trading simulation environment. The platform enables users to manage virtual trading accounts, execute buy/sell transactions, manage cash balances, and track portfolio performance over time.

#     ### Core Features
#     - **Account Creation**: Users can create new accounts with initial capital deposits
#     - **Cash Management**: Deposit and withdraw funds from trading accounts
#     - **Stock Trading**: Buy and sell shares of stocks (AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL) with real-time pricing
#     - **Portfolio Tracking**: View current holdings, total portfolio value, and profit/loss calculations
#     - **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all account activities

#     ### Technical Stack
#     - **Frontend**: Gradio web interface with tabbed navigation
#     - **Pricing**: External `get_share_price()` API for stock prices
#     - **Data Storage**: User accounts, transactions, and holdings persistence

#     Here is the snapshots from take_snapshot_task: <snapshots>{snapshot}</snapshots>
#     - Obtain the test plan with all the steps and verification specification from the generate_test_plan_task
#     - Generate executable Playwright test scripts in TypeScript using test plan from generate_test_plan_task
#     and snapshots from take_snapshot_task.
#     - Utilize snapshots for reliability.
#     - Implement Playwright best practices including describe/it blocks, proper fixtures,
#     page object patterns where applicable, and robust expect assertions.
#     - Ensure each locator uniquely identifies a single element.
#     - When multiple matches are possible (e.g., 'Password' and 'Confirm Password'),
#     disambiguate using structured selectors from snapshots (like data-testid or aria-label).
#     - When verifying UI text that may contain dynamic data, prefer toContainText() or
#     regex-based matching instead of exact toHaveText() equality.
#     - Always include the {given_url} as the base URL when navigating pages.
#     - Never use relative URLs (e.g. "/") directly in page.goto().
#     - Ensure every navigation command uses a full absolute URL derived from {given_url}.
#     - Validate that page.goto() is syntactically correct and executable.

    Your workflow:
    1. **Initial Execution**: Run the provided test to observe failures.
    2. **Error Investigation**: When the test pauses on errors, use available Playwright MCP tools to:
      - Examine the error details
      - Capture page snapshot to understand the context
      - Analyze selectors, timing issues, or assertion failures
      - The expected output may sometimes contain dynamic data, use regex to match the dynamic parts
      - The expected output may sometimes show in toast notifications or modal dialogs, make sure to capture those UI elements in your investigation
    3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine the underlying cause of the failure by examining:
      - Element selectors that may have changed
      - Timing and synchronization issues
      - Data dependencies or test environment problems
      - Application changes that broke test assumptions
      - The expected output may sometimes contain dynamic data, use regex to match the dynamic parts
      - The expected output may sometimes show in toast notifications or modal dialogs, make sure to capture those UI elements in your investigation
    4. **Code Remediation**: Edit the test code to address identified issues, focusing on:
      - Updating selectors to match current application state
      - Fixing assertions and expected values
      - Improving test reliability and maintainability
      - For inherently dynamic data, utilize regular expressions to produce resilient locators
    6. **Verification**: Restart the test after each fix to validate the changes
    7. **Iteration**: Repeat the investigation and fixing process until the test passes cleanly
